\n\n\n\nIt looks like we have 3220 counties with 37 varibles. Two are characters, and the rest are doubles or integers respectively. The race variables seem to measure the percentage of a county is said race. Some of the variables are measured in percentages while others are measured in counts.\n\n\nLooking at the counties with 100 percent white or hispanic populations\nThis seems odd because I would assume that very little communities in the united states would have homogeneous populations.\n\n\nCode\ndemographics |&gt; \n  filter(White == 100 | Hispanic == 100)\n\n\n  CountyId        State                 County TotalPop   Men Women Hispanic\n1    46075 South Dakota           Jones County      740   375   365        0\n2    72019  Puerto Rico Barranquitas Municipio    29237 14398 14839      100\n  White Black Native Asian Pacific VotingAgeCitizen Income IncomeErr\n1   100     0      0     0       0              617  39432      8759\n2     0     0      0     0       0            22093  15694      1496\n  IncomePerCap IncomePerCapErr Poverty ChildPoverty Professional Service Office\n1        26526            3319    10.8          0.0         44.7     9.8   15.1\n2         7716             597    60.7         77.8         28.4    22.3   23.9\n  Construction Production Drive Carpool Transit Walk OtherTransp WorkAtHome\n1         17.2       13.3  61.6     4.5     0.0 20.4         1.9       11.6\n2         14.1       11.3  87.4     6.6     0.8  2.9         0.0        2.3\n  MeanCommute Employed PrivateWork PublicWork SelfEmployed FamilyWork\n1        14.9      430        55.3       16.3         22.6        5.8\n2        31.2     6011        65.7       25.6          8.7        0.0\n  Unemployment\n1          2.9\n2         11.7\n\n\n\nThese communties also report that the populations of the other groups are 0, so I am not concerned with these values.\n\n\n\n\nMissing Values\n\n\nCode\nplot_missing(demographics)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt appears that we have 1 missing value in the child poverty variable\n\n\n\nLooking at the missing data\n\n\nCode\ndemographics |&gt; \n  filter(is.na(ChildPoverty))\n\n\n  CountyId  State         County TotalPop Men Women Hispanic White Black Native\n1    15005 Hawaii Kalawao County       86  41    45      4.7  20.9     0      0\n  Asian Pacific VotingAgeCitizen Income IncomeErr IncomePerCap IncomePerCapErr\n1  29.1    33.7               84  61750     11280        46024            7959\n  Poverty ChildPoverty Professional Service Office Construction Production\n1    12.7           NA         22.2    38.1   20.6            0         19\n  Drive Carpool Transit Walk OtherTransp WorkAtHome MeanCommute Employed\n1  32.8     9.4       0 40.6        10.9        6.3         6.6       63\n  PrivateWork PublicWork SelfEmployed FamilyWork Unemployment\n1        34.9       61.9          3.2          0            0\n\n\n\nWe might want to look further into how to solve for this missing value\n\n\n\nCode\nplot_histogram(demographics)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we can see how some groups are minorites, but what is mre interesting is to see how they look different in communities with different levels of demographics in there population.\n\n\n\n\nLooking at relationships\n\n\nCode\nplot_correlation(demographics)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplot_scatterplot(split_columns(demographics)$continuous, by = \"White\", sampled_rows = 1000L)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplot_scatterplot(split_columns(demographics)$continuous, by = \"Black\", sampled_rows = 1000L)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt looks like an interesting variable to explore is the employment status compared to different races.
