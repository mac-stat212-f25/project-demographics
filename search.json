    "text": "Intro\nLife can be very different depending on what area you live in. For example, price of living, type of household one lives in, as well as how well educated you are, these are all influenced heavily by where you live in the United States. For our project, we wanted to choose two very different counties, comparing and contrasting the differences in the lifestyle of the average person living there.\nACS Background\nThe United States Census Bureau also collects the decennial census, which surveys every citizen in the United States on a ten year cycle. This survey often collects basic information about the population. The Census Bureau also runs the American Community Survey (ACS) which asks more in depth questions. The ACS does not survey all Americans like the census does, which can lead to possible margins of error which are also reported along with the data. Despite this, the ACS offers a deeper look into the demographics of the United States. This is why we chose to work with this data. To access the data from the ACS, we utilized the tidycensus package in RStudio. The tidycensus package allows users of RStudio streamlined access to the Census API, which allows developers to use census and ACS data. This made it easier for us to focus on the following cities and their counties.\nMotivation\nWe decided to choose the two most politically different cities in the United States for our comparison. This paper by Pew Research did a study of the most liberal and conservative big cities in America, assigning each a value from -1 (very liberal) to +1 (very conservative). However, please note that big cities often tend towards liberalism, so while San Francisco (the most liberal city) was assigned a score of -1, Mesa (the most conservative city) was assigned a score of +0.4. To pull the census data, we used counties, so San Francisco became “San Francisco county,” and the city of Mesa became “Maricopa county.”\nVariable Choices\nAlong with our goal to see how polarization and demographics are related, we decided to look at demographics that are most commonly associated with a conservative-liberal or democrat-split. The first of these variables is race. In the American political climate, while political candidates tend to try to reach out to people of different races, they tend to focus their attention on one or two groups and address their issues. Typically, more liberal or democratic views are seen to appeal to more diverse groups while focusing on issues that concern them while more conservative views tend to focus on the average white American and less so on the entire population. The next variable is types of households. What does the living situation of the people who answered the ACS in these areas look like? When listening to debates, you often hear conservatives advocating for traditional values and living situations such as married couples living together with their families and fulfilling the “American Dream”. Liberals don’t tend to have the same view, and value all types of living situations. Income is also a factor that comes into play in American Politics. Both conservative and liberal politicians claim to want to help the working class, however, year after year there seems to be more people from lower income brackets voting for the more conservative candidate. The last variable that we will be analyzing is education. While education and income variables are pretty closely related (people with higher income are more likely to have a higher level of education), there is still a distinct relationship between education levels and the views of a person. Those who tend to have higher levels of income are assumed to be more liberal than those who have had a less rigorous education background. Are these preconceptions consistent with the “most liberal” and “most conservative” cities in the United States and their surrounding areas? Or do we look at demographics too seriously when thinking about political backgrounds.\n\nCode# Getting our data\n# We are making a function to streamline our data collection from tidy census\n\nget_data &lt;- function(city, variable_list){\n  if(city == \"San Francisco\"){\n    return(get_acs(\n      state = \"CA\",\n      county = \"San Francisco\",\n      geography = \"tract\",\n      variables = variable_list,\n      geometry = TRUE,\n      year = 2021\n    )\n    )\n  }\n  else{\n    return(get_acs(\n      state = \"AZ\",\n      county = \"Maricopa\",\n      geography = \"tract\",\n      variables = variable_list,\n      geometry = TRUE,\n      year = 2021\n    )\n    )\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nCode# Since we are going to be making two identical data sets for each variable we are looking at, it is useful to make a function to reduce clutter and chances or error\n\n# This function helps us turn or single value lists into a double\nconvert_to_numeric &lt;- function(value){\n  as.numeric(paste(value))\n}\n\n# This function helps us do the wrangling for the race data\nwrangling_race &lt;- function(data){\n  data |&gt;

The bar plot demonstrates that, while both San Francisco and Maricopa County both have a large percentage of their households that fall in the married couple category, Maricopa County has slightly more. The opposite can be said about live alone households, where San Francisco has a larger percentage of their households falling under this category than Maricopa County. The maps also show that these trends are more true around the cities, where most census tracts around San Francisco have the majority of their households that fall within a non-traditional housing category. More of the census tracts that surround Mesa have the majority of their households fall under the married couple category, which backs up our original idea.\n\nCodecols = c(\"#edf8fb\", \"#b2e2e2\",\"#66c2a4\",\"#2ca25f\",\"#006d2c\")\nmake_sanfrancisco(sanfrancisco_income,sanfrancisco_income$cat, \"San Francisco County Median Income Distribution\", \"Median Income\",cols)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCodecols = c(\"#edf8fb\", \"#b2e2e2\",\"#66c2a4\",\"#2ca25f\",\"#006d2c\")\nmake_mesa(mesa_income, mesa_income$cat,\"Maricopa County Median Income Distribution\", \"Median Income\",cols)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCodeavg_income &lt;- get_acs(\n  geography = \"county\",\n  variables = c(\"B07011_001\"),\n  year = 2023\n) %&gt;%\n  summarize(income = mean(estimate, na.rm = TRUE)/1000) %&gt;%\n  mutate(county = \"Average U.S County\")\n\nsf_income &lt;- get_acs(\n  state = \"CA\",\n  county = \"San Francisco\",\n  geography = \"county\",\n  variables = c(\"B07011_001\"),\n  year = 2023\n)\n\nms_income &lt;- get_acs(\n  state = \"AZ\",\n  county = \"Maricopa\",\n  geography = \"county\",\n  variables = c(\"B07011_001\"),\n  year = 2023\n)\n\nincome_data &lt;- rbind(sf_income, ms_income)%&gt;%\n  select(NAME, estimate) %&gt;%\n  rename(\"county\" = \"NAME\",\n         \"income\" = \"estimate\")  %&gt;%\n  mutate(county = case_when(\n    county == \"San Francisco County, California\" ~ \"San Francisco\",\n    county == \"Maricopa County, Arizona\" ~ \"Maricopa\"),\n    income = income/1000) |&gt; \n  rbind(avg_income) \n\nggplot(income_data, aes(x = county, y = income, fill = county)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Average Annual Income in Two Counties\",\n    x = \"County\",\n    y = \"Income (thousand)\",\n    fill = \"County\"\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\n    \"Average U.S County\" = \"#7F7F7F\",\n    \"Maricopa\" = \"#C0392B\",\n    \"San Francisco\" = \"#2C7FB8\"\n  ))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#Income San Francisco county had a much larger average annual income ($69,000), than Maricopa ($43,000).

This could be because Maricopa county is quite large, and incorporated more areas than San Francisco County, which could have resulted in the more even distribution of highest degree levels.\n\nCoderadar_house &lt;- household_data %&gt;%\n  select(-population) %&gt;%\n  mutate(prop = abs(prop)) %&gt;%\n  pivot_wider(\n    names_from = household,\n    values_from = prop\n  )\n\nradar_race &lt;- race_data %&gt;%\n  select(-population) %&gt;%\n  mutate(prop = abs(prop)) %&gt;%\n  pivot_wider(\n    names_from = race,\n    values_from = prop\n  )\n\nradar_education &lt;- education_data %&gt;%\n  mutate(prop = abs(prop)) %&gt;%\n  pivot_wider(\n    names_from = education,\n    values_from = prop\n  )\n\nradar_total &lt;- cbind(radar_house, radar_race %&gt;% select(-county), radar_education %&gt;% select(-county))\n\ncolnames(radar_house) &lt;- str_wrap(colnames(radar_house), width = 15)\ncolnames(radar_race) &lt;- str_wrap(colnames(radar_race), width = 15)\ncolnames(radar_education) &lt;- str_wrap(colnames(radar_education), width = 15)\ncolnames(radar_total) &lt;- str_wrap(colnames(radar_total), width = 15)\n\n\n\nCode# Radar with House Variables\nggradar(\n  radar_house,\n  group.colours = c(\"#C0392B\", \"#2C7FB8\"),\n  axis.label.size = 4,\n  grid.label.size = 0,\n  axis.label.offset = 1.2\n) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Household Comparision across Two Counties\",\n    subtitle = \"Measured by Percent of Observed Population\"\n) +\n  theme(\n  plot.title    = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n  plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n  legend.title = element_text(size = 15),\n  legend.text  = element_text(size = 9)\n) +\n  guides(color = guide_legend(title = \"County\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode# Radar with Race Variables\nggradar(\n  radar_house,\n  group.colours = c(\"#C0392B\", \"#2C7FB8\"),\n  axis.label.size = 4,\n  grid.label.size = 0,\n  axis.label.offset = 1.2\n) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Race Comparision across Two Counties\",\n    subtitle = \"Measured by Percent of Observed Population\"\n) +\n  theme(\n  plot.title    = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n  plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n  legend.title = element_text(size = 15),\n  legend.text  = element_text(size = 9)\n) +\n  guides(color = guide_legend(title = \"County\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCodeggradar(\n  radar_education,\n  group.colours = c(\"#C0392B\", \"#2C7FB8\"),\n  axis.label.size = 4,\n  grid.label.size = 0,\n  axis.label.offset = 1.2\n) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Education Comparision across Two Counties\",\n    subtitle = \"Measured by Percent of Observed Population\"\n) +\n  theme(\n  plot.title    = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n  plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n  legend.title = element_text(size = 15),\n  legend.text  = element_text(size = 9)\n) +\n  guides(color = guide_legend(title = \"County\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCodeggradar(\n  radar_total,\n  group.colours = c(\"#C0392B\", \"#2C7FB8\"),\n  axis.label.size = 4,\n  grid.label.size = 0,\n  axis.label.offset = 1.2\n) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"All Variable Comparision across Two Counties\",\n    subtitle = \"Measured by Percent of Observed Population\"\n) +\n  theme(\n  plot.title    = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n  plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n  legend.title = element_text(size = 15),\n  legend.text  = element_text(size = 9)\n) +\n  guides(color = guide_legend(title = \"County\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLarger Scale\nWe then decided to determine which variable had the largest discrepancy between San Francisco and Maricopa county. By creating a radar plot, we determined that the white population from the race data was the most different between the two counties.\nWhen plotting the percentage of each state that is white who answered the survey, strong trends that we saw in our radar plots were not as strongly reflected, showing that at a larger scale, the states that are more white aren’t necessarily more conservative. We can see this most clearly with states such as Minnesota and Vermont, both of which run liberal, but also have a high percentage of white people. The opposite can be said for states like Texas and Florida, which both tend to be in the middle when it comes to the percentage of the population that is white, but they tend to run more conservative. This suggests that the trends we observed at the county level might not be able to be more widely applied at the state level.",

37 varibles. Two are characters, and the rest are doubles or integers respectively. The race variables seem to measure the percentage of a county is said race. Some of the variables are measured in percentages while others are measured in counts.\n\nLooking at the counties with 100 percent white or hispanic populations\nThis seems odd because I would assume that very little communities in the united states would have homogeneous populations.\n\nCodedemographics |&gt; \n  filter(White == 100 | Hispanic == 100)\n\n  CountyId        State                 County TotalPop   Men Women Hispanic\n1    46075 South Dakota           Jones County      740   375   365        0\n2    72019  Puerto Rico Barranquitas Municipio    29237 14398 14839      100\n  White Black Native Asian Pacific VotingAgeCitizen Income IncomeErr\n1   100     0      0     0       0              617  39432      8759\n2     0     0      0     0       0            22093  15694      1496\n  IncomePerCap IncomePerCapErr Poverty ChildPoverty Professional Service Office\n1        26526            3319    10.8          0.0         44.7     9.8   15.1\n2         7716             597    60.7         77.8         28.4    22.3   23.9\n  Construction Production Drive Carpool Transit Walk OtherTransp WorkAtHome\n1         17.2       13.3  61.6     4.5     0.0 20.4         1.9       11.6\n2         14.1       11.3  87.4     6.6     0.8  2.9         0.0        2.3\n  MeanCommute Employed PrivateWork PublicWork SelfEmployed FamilyWork\n1        14.9      430        55.3       16.3         22.6        5.8\n2        31.2     6011        65.7       25.6          8.7        0.0\n  Unemployment\n1          2.9\n2         11.7\n\n\n\nThese communties also report that the populations of the other groups are 0, so I am not concerned with these values.\n\nMissing Values\n\nCodeplot_missing(demographics)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt appears that we have 1 missing value in the child poverty variable\n\nLooking at the missing data\n\nCodedemographics |&gt; \n  filter(is.na(ChildPoverty))\n\n  CountyId  State         County TotalPop Men Women Hispanic White Black Native\n1    15005 Hawaii Kalawao County       86  41    45      4.7  20.9     0      0\n  Asian Pacific VotingAgeCitizen Income IncomeErr IncomePerCap IncomePerCapErr\n1  29.1    33.7               84  61750     11280        46024            7959\n  Poverty ChildPoverty Professional Service Office Construction Production\n1    12.7           NA         22.2    38.1   20.6            0         19\n  Drive Carpool Transit Walk OtherTransp WorkAtHome MeanCommute Employed\n1  32.8     9.4       0 40.6        10.9        6.3         6.6       63\n  PrivateWork PublicWork SelfEmployed FamilyWork Unemployment\n1        34.9       61.9          3.2          0            0\n\n\n\nWe might want to look further into how to solve for this missing value\n\n\nCodeplot_histogram(demographics)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we can see how some groups are minorites, but what is mre interesting is to see how they look different in communities with different levels of demographics in there population.\n\nLooking at relationships\n\nCodeplot_correlation(demographics)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCodeplot_scatterplot(split_columns(demographics)$continuous, by = \"White\", sampled_rows = 1000L)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCodeplot_scatterplot(split_columns(demographics)$continuous, by = \"Black\", sampled_rows = 1000L)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt looks like an interesting variable to explore is the employment status compared to different races.
