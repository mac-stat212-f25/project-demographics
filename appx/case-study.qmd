We decided to look at https://pudding.cool/2017/01/making-it-big/ for our case study.

Visualization Overview:

What we like:

- Interactive Visualization at the beginning makes it easier to visualize the concept that it is hard to make it big and the chances of big success are slim.

- Timeline for individual bands make it easy to see, just how long and the normal progression it takes to "make it big".

- Provides the reader a chance to look at their own favorite bands. Provides a timeline for all bands in the dataset organized by alphabetical order.

- Consistent color palette is used through out the visualizations add a sense of cohesiveness.

- Additional annotations are in the visualizations to make points clearer.
